Description:
This is an external utility for Fable 3 that automates the editing of debug scripts. It allows you to toggle debug commands via a simple user interface, eliminating the need to manually edit Lua files every time.

REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT):
This tool requires the Improved Script Injector (aka Console) mod to function.
Download it here: https://www.nexusmods.com/fableIII/mods/12
Please ensure the Script Injector is installed and working before using this tool.


Installation:
- Download the latest version from: https://github.com/GLiTcHz2/Nexus-Fable3-Debug-Menu/releases/
- Extract the Fable 3 Debug Menu folder to a convenient location (Desktop, Documents, etc.).
(Note: Do not run directly from inside the ZIP file).
- Launch Fable3DebugMenu.exe

How to Use:
- Click the Browse button at the top.
- Navigate to your Fable 3 game folder and select the MyScript01.lua file located in: \data\scripts\MyMod\
(You might be able to use MyScipt02.lua but I have not tested it yet)
- Once set, the controls will be enabled.
- Toggle options On/Off as desired. The changes are saved to the Lua file immediately.

Troubleshooting:
* Gold/Seals Buttons are Disabled: You must click the Help button and check the "I Agree" box regarding game balance to unlock these features.
